This program sorts numbers within a specified array size. 
User specifies how many numbers they would like to be sorted. 
Once this is done, user is prompted to type in the numbers one be one in no specific order, pressing enter after each number. 
After user has given the array size and the numbers they would like sorted, the program puts the numbers in order. 
Program is able to sort an array of all negative numbers along with an array of positive and negative numbers.
Source code can be viewed and manipulated through text editor of users choice but program has to be run through QtSpim. 
Edge Case:
If user types in nothing for either prompts, program will output that the elements sorted is null.
